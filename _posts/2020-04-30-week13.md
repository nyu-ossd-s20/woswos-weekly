title: "Week 13: Group projects, group projects, group projects!"
excerpt: "This week was all about group projects!"
---


Yes, this week was all about group projects. Actually, we planned to have a lecture with Stewart Weiss about 'bash' and command line tools in addition to the group project presentation. I was pretty excited about the lecture, but unfortunately, it got canceled. Even without the lecture, I learned about the [ide.cs50.io](https://ide.cs50.io/) website, and I can't imagine the useful thigns I could have learned with Stewart Weiss. The website seems to be a super useful tool for getting a Linux terminal and a basic text editor on the go. I am sure I will need it at some point in my life, and I am glad that I learned it. Besides the canceled class, we had the project presentations for talking about our progress. It was amazing to see how teams advanced since the last presentations we had. I saw that some teams made many small contributions while others did fewer but larger (I mean things that take more time) contributions. There were even teams that decided to start with "small" contributions, and these "small" contributions turned out to be a lot more complicated than they initially anticipated. I think it is a part of the learning experience, and it shows that even the simplest things might take a lot of time when doing a coding project. While presenting this week, I was definitely more confident since we actually had some progress to present. We spent a lot of time on the PowerPoint presentation last time, and we didn't need to spend that much time on it. I believe we did a better presentation when compared to the previous one without a PowerPoint presentation.


### Group project progress
I think we had a lot of progress this week. We got two documentation contributions ([PR #8322](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/8322) and [PR #8326](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/pull/8326)) merged to the master! These were the two problems with the documentation that I reported previously in the issue [#8259](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/8259) about the installation steps. The previous contributors simply jumped between the steps and didn't explain some of the steps clearly. So, I added a few notes for beginners like me to complete the installation successfully.

We are still waiting for the feedback on the issue [#8257](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/8257) about adding visual clues for showing hidden files in the file browser within JupyterLab. Meanwhile, we are looking for new issues to contribute to and report. JupyterLab is a relatively new product, and there are a lot of missing features and bugs waiting to be fixed/built.

Also, I don't know what it means exactly, but I received an invitation to join the JupyterLab organization on GitHub! It is motivating for my future contributions. I wasn't 100% sure about keeping contributing to JupyterLab after the class, but now I will stick for a while at least. Let's see how it goes. I really like being part of this class and contributing to open source projects!
